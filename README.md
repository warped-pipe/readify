# Introduction
**Trying to read an article with annoying ads or interruptions?** readify.me provides a safe, easy, open-source solution that allows you to read articles in peace - all without the need to download any software, create an account or even store any cookies! It also allows you to bypass annoying paywalls on some sites.

# New features in version 2.0!
I have forked from [**jotslo's**](https://github.com/jotslo) original [**readify.me**](https://github.com/jotslo/readify.me/tree/main) codebase that was seemingly abandoned.
- Added option to right-click a link and "Open in Readify" to the Chrome extension.
- Added a Firefox extension
- Fixed some code in both the extensions and main applet that I felt could be optimized
- **Added bot-spoofing!** -- the applet will now appear as a GoogleBot when requesting sites in an attempt to bypass paywalls. This is an alpha feature -- feel free to contribute!

# How to use readify.me
Using readify.me is incredibly simple! Just go to view any article on a modern web browser and place readify.me/ before the website's link.
